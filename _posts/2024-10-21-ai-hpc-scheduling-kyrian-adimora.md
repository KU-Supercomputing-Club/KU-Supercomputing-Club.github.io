## Presentation Summary

In the ever-evolving landscape of High-Performance Computing (HPC), efficient resource management remains a critical challenge. My presentation introduces a groundbreaking approach to HPC scheduling that harnesses the power of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to dramatically improve system performance.

## Key Highlights

1. **Unveiling the limitations of traditional scheduling algorithms in modern HPC environments**
2. **Introduction to a novel GNN-RL hybrid model for intelligent, adaptive scheduling**
3. **Demonstration of significant improvements in resource utilization, job throughput, and makespan reduction**
4. **Real-world application using Argonne Leadership Computing Facility workload data**
5. **Future directions in AI-driven HPC optimization**

This research represents a significant leap forward in HPC resource management, promising to accelerate scientific discoveries across various fields, from climate modeling to drug discovery.
